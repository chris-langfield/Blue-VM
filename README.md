# Blue-VM
(Experiment) 32 bit register VM in C with custom assembly language and REPL (currently only accepting hex instructions).

For educational and curiosity purposes, this program is being built with the loose goal of being able to interpret a custom programming language.

A lot of bit-shifting fun! ðŸ¤“

Based heavily on two tutorial sources:

[https://blog.subnetzero.io/post/building-language-vm-part-00/](https://blog.subnetzero.io/post/building-language-vm-part-00/) (Rust)

[https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/) (C)

Also appreciated the examples in [this article](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) while creating the REPL.
